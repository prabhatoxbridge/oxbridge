## _We are proudly inclusive of a range of academic abilities and judge success by development and progress. Our promise is that every child will exceed beyond expectation._

_Happiness and achievement go hand in hand. Whatever her ability, tailored academic interventions by specialist staff and bespoke learning plans ensure our girls achieve. The well-being of every girl is paramount. We talk to each child daily, encouraging her to share thoughts and feelings with staff trained to recognise behavioural and emotional changes._
