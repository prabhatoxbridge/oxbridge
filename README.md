# _An education for life going way beyond the curriculum._
## _We are proudly inclusive of a range of academic abilities and judge success by development and progress. Our promise is that every child will exceed beyond expectation._

_Happiness and achievement go hand in hand. Whatever her ability, tailored academic interventions by specialist staff and bespoke learning plans ensure our girls achieve. The well-being of every girl is paramount. We talk to each child daily, encouraging her to share thoughts and feelings with staff trained to recognise behavioural and emotional changes._

_Our mission is to empower girls to discover, nurture and project their unique identities and character._

**_"The morning routine in every household starts with the journey to school. Usually, this is straightforward but because of COVID-19, we are now asking ourselves what the safest way is in which our kids can travel to school."_**

_Taking the hassle out of the school run._
